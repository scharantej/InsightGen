## **Flask Application Design**

### **Problem:**
"Want to build an application that can take data table as input and generated insights out of it."

### **Proposed Flask Application:**

### **HTML Files:**

1. **index.html:**
   - Landing page for the application.
   - Contains a form for the user to upload a data table as a CSV file.
   - Includes a submit button to initiate the insights generation process.


2. **results.html:**
   - Displays the insights generated from the uploaded data table.
   - Presents the insights in an organized and readable manner.
   - May include charts, visualizations, and statistical summary tables.


3. **error.html:**
   - Handles error scenarios, such as invalid file format or data processing errors.
   - Provides a user-friendly error message and instructions for resolving the issue.


### **Routes:**

1. **/upload_table:**
   - Route to handle the CSV file upload.
   - Receives the uploaded file and stores it on the server.
   - Initiates the data processing and insights generation process.
   - Redirects to the results page once the insights are ready.


2. **/get_results:**
   - Route to retrieve the generated insights.
   - Checks if the insights are available and returns them in a JSON format.
   - The front-end can use this JSON data to populate the results page.


3. **/error:**
   - Route for handling errors that may occur during the file upload or data processing.
   - Displays the error message and instructions to the user.


4. **/:**
   - Default route that redirects to the index page.

### **Explanation:**

- The application consists of three HTML files: `index.html` for the input form, `results.html` for displaying the insights, and `error.html` for handling errors.


- The Flask application defines four routes:
  - **/upload_table:** Receives the uploaded CSV file and triggers the insights generation process.
  - **/get_results:** Retrieves the generated insights in JSON format.
  - **/error:** Displays error messages to the user.
  - **/:** Default route that redirects to the index page.


- The front-end of the application will utilize these routes to interact with the Flask server. For example, the form in `index.html` will submit the data table to the **/upload_table** route, and the results page will fetch the insights from the **/get_results** route.


- The actual implementation of the data processing and insights generation logic is not included in this design, as it involves specific statistical or machine learning techniques. The Flask application will integrate with appropriate Python libraries and algorithms to perform these tasks.


- The application is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for uploading data tables and presenting the generated insights in a clear and informative manner.
